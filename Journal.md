# TODO

## Starting

1. Install [Flow, Sumo, RLlib](https://flow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flow_setup.html#local-installation-of-flow)
2. Complete tutorials in [FLOW](https://github.com/flow-project/flow/tree/master/tutorials), especially (0,1,3,5,6,8)

## Project

### Scenarios

We can either import map with [OpenStreetMap](https://github.com/flow-project/flow/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial06_osm.ipynb)
or create a custom one with [Scenario](https://github.com/flow-project/flow/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial05_scenarios.ipynb).
 
- Starting with a custom grid map

### Environment
Check out the [environment tutorial](https://github.com/flow-project/flow/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial08_environments.ipynb)
for this part. This part covers the Autonomous agents using RL.

Here we need to specify the:
- Action space (using gym)
- Observable space
- Reward
